# Arduino-Samples
A collection of Arduino sample sketches I use in various maker sessions to teach programming with Arduino Wiring. Note that these samples can be loaded standalone in the Arduino IDE, or you can load the entire solution (.sln) in Visual Studio using the [Arduino IDE Extension for Visual Studio](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/069a905d-387d-4415-bc37-665a5ac9caba), aka Visual Micro.

## Samples
* Clear Board: Empty sketch to reset your Arduino
* Blink
* Dimmer
* Ultrasonic

## The Maker Show: Episode 2 - Blinking LED...Now What?
In [this episode of The Maker Show](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/themakershow/2), Brian Sherwin starts with the "Hello World" of electronics: Blinking and LED. But what do you do after that? In this video, we will use the Arduino to introduce a few new ways to work with your blinking LED from inputs with buttons and potentiometers to viewing input in the serial monitor.
