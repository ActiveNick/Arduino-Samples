# Arduino-Samples
A collection of Arduino samples I use in various maker sessions to teach programming with Arduino.

## The Maker Show: Episode 2 - Blinking LED...Now What?
In [this episode of The Maker Show](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/themakershow/2), Brian Sherwin starts with the "Hello World" of electronics: Blinking and LED. But what do you do after that? In this video, we will use the Arduino to introduce a few new ways to work with your blinking LED from inputs with buttons and potentiometers to viewing input in the serial monitor.
